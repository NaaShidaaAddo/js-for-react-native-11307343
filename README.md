## Explanation of Each Task

### Task 1: processArray Function
  Task One takes an array of numbers as the argument to the function processArray. 
  The array is processed by the function such that even numbers are squared and odd numbers are tripled.
  A new array is created after this processing.

### Task 2: formatArrayStrings Function
  Task Two takes two arrays as arguments to the function formatArrayStrings, one of which contains only strings and the other being the processed array from Task One.
  Each string in the strings array is modified such that if the number a string corresponds to is even, that entire string is capitalized. If the number is odd however, that string is converted to lowercase. 


### Task 3: createUserProfiles Function
  Task Three takes an array of names, which is the strings array used in Task Two, and the modified array from Task Two.
  It returns a new array containing each original name, each modified name and corresponding id's, from the two arrays.
